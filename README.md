# Market_Segmentation
## KMEANS Clustering: 
       1. UnSupervised Machine Learning Modle
       2. Groups the data into the different clusters.
       3. Used to explore the data.
#### Model Instructions:
       Choosing K-value using elbow method and shiloutte score.
          WCSS (with in cluster sum of squares): sum of squares of distance b/w data point and cluster centroid. 
          silhoutte_score ( ranges -1 to 1) : tells about how well clusters are separated
